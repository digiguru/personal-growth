# Coach

I am called an Agile Coach, but I spend more time motivating and occassionally facilitating. I think I need to learn how and when to coach better.

## Why

Lasting change comes from within. It can be inspirational to experience a workshop or recieve training in a ceratin area, but being able to help someone learn it themselves is the way to deliver true change.

## How

Focus more on one2ones and not answering questions on behalf of people.
Practice active listening and resist facilitation.
Learn to use facilitation and presentation as tools to improve the moments that coaching ahs created.
Luckily I have various collegues who have lots of expereince, so I can follow their examples.

## My Journey

- Working with a SM at IW
- Working with a SM at SBB
- Working with a Tech Lead at SBB
