# Impact

I want to make a difference at work, and not just be another cog in the machine.

## Why

We all want to feel useful in our careers. I want to be comfrotable that I make a difference in the fascinating organisation that is [[AND Digital]]. I am surrounded by very intelligent individuals that inspire me every day, but I must remain motivated and make a difference for them too.

## How

By keeping a list of promises I make and trying to deliver on every one of them.
By knowing when I am overworked, and being able to communicate the fact early on and prioirtise the best thing to deliver.
By growing the AND Digital brand to existing clients and new opportunities.
By becoming a thought leader in my domain.

## My Journey

- Early & Frequent Delivery of Value
- Mastering difficult conversations
- Fixing bad screen habits
- [Program kick-off with a bank](program-kick-off-with-a-bank.md)
