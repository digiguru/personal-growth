- Write up ideas for [[personal growth]] (Remember you can `Cmd`+`Click` to them)
- In each section I need to pad out the content
- Explain what it is, why I want it and how I will know it is working.
- There's also a [[todo]] to list the three things I'm focusing on.

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[todo]: todo "Todo"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"ces"
