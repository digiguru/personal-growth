# Ally

Being a good ally is about seeing injustices and taking action to support a way to make all individuals have an equitable way to be treated. That means deliberately amplifying the voices of people who are often overlooked, and trying to address systematic barriers.

## Why

It simply isn't fair to ignore privilege.

## How

Actively seek out people in tech from minority groups, (Gender, BAME, Mental health) and amplify their voices, help them become role models for others and ensure that we don't sleepwalk into further causing an industry that is less diverse.

## My Journey

I am pursuing people to talk at [[agile-reading]] who represent a minority or have a subject that deliberately gives voice to underrepresented groups.
Target one 2 one coaching on people who feel left out.
Be deliberately [[curious]] about things I do not understand
Moderate my use of language so as I don't knowingly contribute to system racism, sexism or other fallacies eg...

- `Folks` (not `Guys`)
- `Distributer - Consumer` (not `Master - Slave`)
- `That's unusual` (not `That's crazy`)
