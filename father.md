# Father

I have 3 awesome boys, but they are growing up fast.

## Why

Lock-down has been a struggle for me and I feel like I've been failing my children. A lot of people fall into accidental parenting (and accidental leadership). I need to be deliberate in my parenting, and help my children grow a resilience and manners they need to cope in a fast paced society.

## How

- Get into healthy habits around how we present ourselves. Be aware of how much time we dedicate to exercise & mindfulness
- Be consistent in parenting with my wife, so that they have clear vision on what excellence looks like
- Encourage them to try new foods and opt for nourishing meals rather than fast food
