# Coder

Always understand what it is like to be a coder.

## Why

Alot of Agile Coaching comes down to development teams creating coded improvments on projects. I feel to build bridges with these team members I should be able to talk their language, lead by example and be able to challange them when they are assuming their views are a special case.

## How

Keep my side projects working with the lastest technology. Activly take parts in hack-a-thons. Facilitate those around me to upskill team members in the latest technology.
