# Coder

Always understand what it is like to be a coder.

## Why

A lot of Agile Coaching comes down to development teams creating coded improvements on projects. I feel to build bridges with these team members I should be able to talk their language, lead by example and be able to challenge them when they are assuming their views are a special case.

In the coaching team we have a mix of qualities, and this is the unique skill I bring to the team. I know I lack in areas around Product Management, Business Ownership and Coaching Skills. If I can continue to contribute my coding skills, then I bring diversity of thought to the team.

## How

Keep my side projects working with the latest technology. Actively take parts in hack-a-thons. Facilitate those around me to up-skill team members in the latest technology.
